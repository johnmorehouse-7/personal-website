I am an economist currently working on a "stealth" startup in the resiliency space. I'll have more on that soon.

I am originally from Petaluma, CA. I received my B.S, M.S, and Ph.D from the University of Oregon. Before the startup, I was at Freddie Mac working on climate risk. During the Summer of 2021, I was a dissertation intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. I spent the Summer of 2020 with Vivid Economics as an intern and continued as a freelance economist for the remainder of the year. At Vivid, I led the development of demand projections for a global energy model.

I started riding bikes when I was around 12 years old — after I was diagnosed with a severe case of Sever's disease, which caused chronic pain until I had surgery a few years later. I had the opportunity to participate in the NorCal High School Cycling League and then later got into road racing in college.

Other than work and pedaling, I enjoy traveling and reading.
