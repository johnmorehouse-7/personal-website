I am originally from Petaluma, CA. I'm currently working on a stealth startup in the resiliency space. I received my B.S, M.S, and Ph.D from the University of Oregon. During my graduate studies, I interned at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and at Vivid Economics, where I led the development of demand projections for a global energy model.

I started riding bikes when I was around 12 years old — after I was diagnosed with a severe case of Sever's disease, which caused chronic pain until I had surgery a few years later. I had the opportunity to participate in the NorCal High School Cycling League and then later got into road racing in college.

Other than work and pedaling, I enjoy traveling and reading.
